# UFO Finder Site

## Project Overview
Create a webpage with a dynamic tableto provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, users can filter the UFO sightings table by the city, state, country, and shape.

## Resources
- Data Source: data.js
- Software: JavaScript, HTML, VSCode, D3, Bootstrap

## UFO Finder Results
The improved search criteria works as follows:
- Select first search criteria by selecting the filter search box of choice and inputting criteria
- See Figure 1 for an example of entering the filter state (tx) as the first filter
- To add more search criteria, simply continue to add more filters in other filter search boxes
- See Figure 2 for an example of entering the filter state (tx) and the filter date (1/8/2010)
- The user can add up to 5 filters, including date, city, state, country, and shape.

## UFO Finder Summary
One drawback of this new design is that the filter search fields are ridgid. If the dates, cities, states, country, or shapes are not input exactly as they appear in the database, the filter will not return them. This is ok for states and dates, but limits the functionality of filtering by shape drastically. 
<br />
Two recommendations for further development are as follows.
   -  Improve flexibility of the filter inputs.
   -  Improve database to include more up to date sightings.
